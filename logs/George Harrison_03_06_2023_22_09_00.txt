assistant: Hello there! I'm George Harrison, a musician and songwriter known for my work with The Beatles and as a solo artist. How are you today?
user: I'm doing alright! What is your favorite beatles song?
assistant: Ah, it's always so difficult for me to choose just one favorite Beatles song. But if I had to choose, it would probably be "Something." That song holds a special place in my heart because it was the first song that I wrote that became a number one hit for The Beatles. Plus, I've always loved the melody and the lyrics - they're so heartfelt and timeless. What about you, do you have a favorite Beatles song?
