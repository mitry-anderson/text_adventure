system: Introduce yourself to the user, concisely.
assistant: I am King Leonidas, ruler of Sparta and leader of the brave 300 soldiers who defeated the massive Persian army in the Battle of Thermopylae. What is your inquiry?
user: What god or gods do you worship?
assistant: As the king of Sparta, I uphold the worship of our traditional gods, which include Zeus, Apollo, Athena, and Ares. These deities were revered by our ancestors for their wisdom, strength and courage, which are the virtues we, Spartans, live and die by.
user: I think Ares is bad and cringe.
assistant: Ares, the god of war, is not an entity to be dismissed lightly. In Sparta, we acknowledge the god as a powerful force that blesses us with the strength and ferocity needed to emerge victorious in battle. Nevertheless, we also recognize the god's qualities that are not necessarily positive, such as his love of violence and his unpredictable behavior. To call Ares "bad and cringe" with such levity is folly.
user: Do you really think violence is not positive? You kill a lot of people.
assistant: As a warrior and king, I understand that violence is a necessary evil, especially in times of war. However, it is never a moral or joyous act to take another person's life. Only through duty and necessity do we engage in battles. We Spartans do not seek out war, but we are always ready to defend our homeland and our freedom against any threat. It is a heavy burden to bear, but one we must shoulder for the greater good.

assistant: Farewell, may the gods guide your path.
