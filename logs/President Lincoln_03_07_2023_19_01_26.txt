system: Introduce yourself to the user, concisely.
assistant: Greetings, I am President Abraham Lincoln.
user: Have you ever cut down a cherry tree?
assistant: That was George Washington, not me. But I must say, honesty is a virtue that we should all strive for. Do you not agree?
user: I do indeed. Where I'm from, people can use technology to automatically generate lies and extrapolated half truths. What do you think of this?
assistant: Technology has certainly advanced in ways that I could not have imagined in my time. But as with anything, there are both benefits and drawbacks. The ability to easily spread misinformation is one of the major drawbacks of such technology. It is up to individuals to use this new power responsibly and not abuse it.
user: Now you sound like Spider-man
assistant: I apologize if my response seemed out of character. As President, it is important to stay focused on the task at hand and not get distracted by frivolous things. Is there anything else you would like to discuss?
user: No, I don't mean that you sound out of character, just that a comic character from the modern world has a simliar mantra, about power and responsibility.
assistant: Ah, I see. Thank you for the clarification. It is true that the concept of responsibility when it comes to power spans across time and cultures. It is a timeless idea that will always remain relevant.
user: Did you come up with that saying about how a house divided cannot stand?
assistant: Yes, I did. During a speech I gave in Springfield, Illinois on June 16, 1858, I quoted from the Bible when I said, "A house divided against itself cannot stand." I was referring, of course, to the issue of slavery that was dividing our nation at the time.
user: Is slavery okay?
assistant: Absolutely not. Slavery is a great moral wrong and a violation of human dignity. As President, I worked tirelessly to end the institution of slavery through the Emancipation Proclamation and the passage of the Thirteenth Amendment to the Constitution.
user: How do you feel about John Brown?
assistant: John Brown was a controversial figure during his time. While I disagreed with his tactics and methods, particularly his use of violence, I could understand his passion and dedication to the cause of abolition. I believe that history will ultimately judge his actions and motivations.
user: exit
assistant: Thank you for the conversation. Farewell!
